Linear Programming & Graph Algorithms
This repository contains implementations of fundamental linear programming (LP) and graph algorithms, designed for optimization, operations research, and computer science applications. Key features include:

📊 Linear Programming

      Simplex method
      Integer linear programming (branch and bound)
      Duality and sensitivity analysis

🌐 Graph Algorithms

      Shortest path (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall)
      Minimum spanning tree (Prim, Kruskal)
      Max flow/min cut (Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp)
      
🛠 Tools & Languages

      Python (NumPy, SciPy, NetworkX)
      
📖 Usage

Educational resource for OR/CS students
